  You are free to create as many classes within the hw5.py file or across 
  multiple files as you need. However, ensure that the hw5.py file is the 
  only one that contains a __main__ method. This specific setup is crucial 
  because your instructor will run the hw5.py file to execute and evaluate 
  your work.
